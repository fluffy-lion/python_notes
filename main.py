# variables, expressions and statements

# CONSTANTS
# dont change
# fixed values
# used to start calculations 

print(123)

# reserved words
# special words where python is listening to them
# you cannot use reserved words as variables names / identifiers
# eg False None True class if lambda continue finally...

# VARIABLES
# a way to ask python to allocate memory and give it a name 
# through the assignment statement = 

x = 12
y = 14

# can change the content of a variable in a later statement

# naming rules
# must stat with a letter or underscore
# consiste of letters, numbers and underscore
# case sensitive

# mnemonic variable names
# help us remember what we intend to store in them
# works fine
x8woehdgcb7 = 35
x98wjsmwnm3 = 12.50
print(x8woehdgcb7 * x98wjsmwnm3)
# better
a = 35
b = 12.50
print(a * b)
#even better
hours = 35
rate = 12.50
print(hours * rate)

# helps your reader understand whats going on

# x is variable, 2 is constant, = is operator, print is reserved word
# assignment statement
x = 2
# assignment with expression
x = x + 2
# print statement
print(x)

# assignment statements
# an assignment statement consists of an expression on the right side and a variable to store the result
# evaluates the right before the left
# the result is place in the variable identifier
